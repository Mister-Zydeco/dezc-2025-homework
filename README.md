If you're looking at this page, it's probably because I told you about it. But you might be a grader in the course mentioned in the title above, either an instructor or a fellow student: in these two cases, you navigated here from a breadcrumb -- you didn't have to look at this page for your task. It's also remotely possible that you're a recruiter. If that's true and you're in a hurry, let me save you time. I'm older than what your clients would want.


#### Stage 0: \"Data engineering. Seriously?\"

I first heard the expression \"data engineering\" in the early 1990s. My math friends and I were dismissive of it. What could you possibly do with data that could be called \"engineering\"? I had not worked with data yet, other than as an end-user..

#### Stage 1: There\'s more to it than I at first thought

My first encounter with databases a dive into the deep end of the pool. A large-ish (for the time, 1997-1998) Oracle data warehouse backing a CRM system for managing marketing campaigns in the long-distance telephone service business (sounds quaint today, doesn't it). Ok, handling data was a lot more complicated than I thought, but it still seemed pompous to call our activities "engineering"?

### Stage 2: \"Yes, seriously..."\
I'm the treasurer of my homeowner's association and we insure with State Farm. I think it's fair to call them Luddites. We still haven't figured out how I can get our new policies and other docs online -- it wasn't possible until a few years ago, and there's some problem with the punctuation in the name of our HOA. A couple of years ago, when I was discussing with our agent how slow to modernize State Farm has been, he complained "It's hard partly because we have SO MUCH data." My quick answer was "There are companies who ingest and process in one day more data than State Farm has accumulated in its entire existence" -- a claim that is trivial to demonstrate. At that moment, I realized that the expression \"data engineering\" is more than valid. To make such big data useable requires clusters of computers, new kinds of databases, and processes so complex as to warrant special software to orchestrate them. Calling all that \"engineering\" is no exaggeration.

And so that's why I'm taking this course.
